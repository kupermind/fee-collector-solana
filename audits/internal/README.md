# Internal audit of lockbox-solana
The review has been performed based on the contract code in the following repository:<br>
`https://github.com/valory-xyz/lockbox-governor-solana` <br>
commit: `7a1381a0885a0fad49be24225d6a483c54701a76` or `v0.1.0-pre-internal-audit`<br> 

## Objectives
The audit focused on contracts in folder `programs`.

### Flatten version
N/A

### OS Requirments checks
Pre-requisites (README.md)
```
anchor --version
anchor-cli 0.29.0

rustc --version
rustc 1.74.1 (a28077b28 2023-12-04)
```
Checks - passed [-]

Issue: The versions written in the readme do not match in detail the ones in the script.
```

## Security issues.
### Problems found instrumentally
Several checks are obtained automatically. They are commented. Some issues found need to be fixed. <br>

https://medium.com/@zokyo.io/what-hackers-look-for-in-a-solana-smart-contract-17ec02b69fb6 <br>
1. Missing signer checks (e.g., by checking AccountInfo::is_signer ) <br>
N/A

2. Missing ownership checks (e.g., by checking  AccountInfo::owner) <br>
```rust
pub config: Box<Account<'info, Config>>
pub posted: Box<Account<'info, wormhole::PostedVaa<TransferMessage>>>
pub program_account: UncheckedAccount<'info> (to discussion)
pub buffer_account: UncheckedAccount<'info> (to discussion)

program_account vs program_data_account
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/program/src/bpf_loader_upgradeable.rs#L29
Buffer {
        /// Authority address
        authority_address: Option<Pubkey>,
        // The raw program data follows this serialized structure in the
        // account's data.
    },
    /// An Program account.
    Program {
        /// Address of the ProgramData account.
        programdata_address: Pubkey,
    },
    // A ProgramData account.
    ProgramData {
        /// Slot that the program was last modified.
        slot: u64,
        /// Address of the Program's upgrade authority.
        upgrade_authority_address: Option<Pubkey>,
        // The raw program data follows this serialized structure in the
        // account's data.
    }
```
3. Missing rent exemption checks <br>
in `upgrade_program`? <br>
To discussion. <br>

4. Signed invocation of unverified programs <br>
```rust
// Wormhole program.
/// CHECK: Wormhole program account. Required for posted account check. Read-only.
pub wormhole_program: UncheckedAccount<'info>,
Not checked by address?

pub fn transfer() - OK
pub fn transfer_all() - OK
pub fn transfer_token_accounts() - OK
pub fn set_program_upgrade_authority() - OK
pub fn upgrade_program() - OK
```
To discussion. <br>

5. Solana account confusions: the program fails to ensure that the account data has the type it expects to have. <br>

6. Re-initiation with cross-instance confusion <br>
Passed. Example: https://github.com/coral-xyz/sealevel-attacks/blob/master/programs/4-initialization/recommended/src/lib.rs

7. Arithmetic overflow/underflows: If an arithmetic operation results in a higher or lower value, the value will wrap around with twoâ€™s complement. <br>
```rust
ctx.accounts.config.total_sol_transferred += amount_sol;
ctx.accounts.config.total_olas_transferred += amount_olas;
```
To discussion. <br>

8. Numerical precision errors: numeric calculations on floating point can cause precision errors and those errors can accumulate. <br>
N/A

Notes:
1. Remove msg! in production version.
2. `// TODO: verifications` ? amount > 0?
